Not a good choice for anyone who is serious about his/her studies and career! I got enrolled in the Creative Writing weekend batch in October 2021. After 2-3 sessions, the mentor started canceling the classes every other weekend without any prior intimation. Even after contacting their support via their site and telegram group multiple times, we received no response. Later we got to know they have changed the class timings on their own. Missed a few classes due to this misunderstanding and one day out of the blue I received a call from their representative that the classes are already done and there is one 'bonus' class for us that we can join to resolve our 'queries'. There are no videos available on the site for the said batch on the site. I requested customer support via chat to provide the recordings but instead of asking questions about my batch, they shared with me a link to a site page where, even after spending a good amount of time, I am not able to find a single recording of the classes. Without any guidance from their team, I don't think I would be able to complete this course now and request for the certification. I have wasted a good amount of money and time on this and I suggest you all to properly inquire about everything related to the mentor, timing, assignments, and course duration before paying your hard-earned money to this institute. The contact person will not answer your calls or whatsapp messages once you get enrolled. DON"T pay anything without getting an assurance that the institute's support team will be available for you for your course-related concerns whenever needed.
