I enrolled for Digital Marketing Course here. I had a very great experience, it was worth my time and cost efficient. I learned many relevant topics in this course such as SEO, Social Media, Website designing and planning, Google Ads, Linkedin and facebook marketing. Digital Marketing is in high demand now and i was very satisfied with the course content and trainer.

Also, i did the internship of the same for 3 months. Had the best work experience with Henry Harvin. My internship period was very beneficial with the guidance of Surabhi Maam, Harshita Maam and Piyush sir.
Surabhi and Harshita Ma'am were very interactive and co-operative. I am glad to have learned so much from here.Thank you Henry Harvin.
